  AC-20:
    Control Name: USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS
    Description:
      - The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships established
        with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information systems, allowing
      - authorized individuals to:
        - a. Access the information system from external information systems; and
        - b. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information systems.
    Supplemental Guidance: |
      External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside
      of the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which organizations typically have no
      direct supervision and authority over the application of required security controls or the assessment of
      control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example:
      (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants);
      (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities
      (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports);
      (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and
      (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and
      authority of organizations.

      This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or
      transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services
      (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational
      information systems.

      For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies,
      including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established
      between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and
      conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not be considered external.
      These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit
      or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when
      such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies.

      Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals
      with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority
      to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on
      authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust
      relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security
      restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.

      This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to
      organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov).
      Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance
      with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of
      applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems;
      and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external
      information systems.

      If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations
      may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.

        - b. When required by information system changes; and
        - c. [Assignment:organization-defined frequency] thereafter.

    Supplemental Guidance: |
      Organizations determine the appropriate content of security training based on the assigned roles and responsibilities
      of individuals and the specific security requirements of organizations and the information systems to which personnel
      have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide enterprise architects, information system developers,
      software developers, acquisition/procurement officials, information system managers, system/network administrators,
      personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification
      and validation activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level software,
      adequate security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based
      training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel,
      and technical safeguards and countermeasures. Such training can include for example, policies, procedures, tools,
      and artifacts for the organizational security roles defined. Organizations also provide the training necessary for
      individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within the context
      of organizational information security programs. Role-based security training also applies to contractors providing
      services to federal agencies.

    Control Name: AUDIT EVENTS
    Description:
      The organization:
        - a. Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events:[Assignment:organization-defined auditable events];
        - b. Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit- related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;
        - c. Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after- the-fact investigations of security incidents; and
        - d. Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system:[Assignment:organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the 
          frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].
    Supplemental Guidance: |
      An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system. Organizations identify audit events as those events 
      which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to 
      meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses 
      related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. 
      In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be 
      implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of 
      auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have 
      the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific 
      circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, 
      may be referenced in other security controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by 
      applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at 
      various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of 
      abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. 
      Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, 
      transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.

    Control Name: TIME STAMPS
    Description:
      The information system:
        - a. Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and
        - b. Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment:organization-defined granularity of time measurement].
    Supplemental Guidance: |
      Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), 
      a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to 
      the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of 
      milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components. 
      Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, 
      depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

    Control Name: LEAST FUNCTIONALITY
    Description:
      The organization:

        - b. Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, and/or services:[Assignment:organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or services].
    Supplemental Guidance: |
      Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services,
      provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).
      Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components,
      but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible,
      organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both).
      Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems,
      to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol,
      Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical
      and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
      on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information,
      or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems,
      and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent
      the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.

    Control Name: IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT
    Description:
      The organization manages information system identifiers by:
        - a. Receiving authorization from [Assignment:organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign an individual, group, role, or device identifier;
        - b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;
        - c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;
        - d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment:organization-defined time period]; and
        - e. Disabling the identifier after [Assignment:organization-defined time period of inactivity].
    Supplemental Guidance: |
      Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers.
      Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically, individual
      identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities
      of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts
      (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information systems). Preventing reuse of
      identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices.

    Control Name: AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT
    Description:
      The organization manages information system authenticators by:
        - a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;
        - b. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;
        - c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;
        - d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;
        - e. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;
        - f. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;
        - g. Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment:organization-defined time period by authenticator type];
        - h. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
        - i. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators; and
        - j. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
    Supplemental Guidance: |
      Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content
      (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship information
      system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well
      known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6
      for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems
      (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems
      support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum
      password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of
      biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators,
      not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes
      issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example,
      certificates and passwords.

    Control Name: AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION
    Description:
      The information system, for password-based authentication:
        - a. Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment:organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];
        - b. Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created:[Assignment:organization-defined number];
        - c. Stores and transmits only encrypted representations of passwords;
        - d. Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment:organization- defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];
        - e. Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment:organization-defined number] generations; and
        - f. Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.
    Supplemental Guidance: |
      This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, when passwords
      are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity Verification cards).
      The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of the requirements in the enhancement. Encrypted representations of passwords include, for example, encrypted versions
      of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions
      in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords.

    Supplemental Guidance:
      This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and
      control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
      policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for
      system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy
      for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations.
      The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
      The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Description:
      The organization provides incident response training to information system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:
        - a. Within [Assignment:organization-defined time period] of assuming an incident response role or responsibility;
        - b. When required by information system changes; and
        - c. [Assignment:organization-defined frequency] thereafter.
    Supplemental Guidance:
      Incident response training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities
      of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training.
      For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the information
      system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident
      responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident
      response training includes user training in the identification and reporting of suspicious activities, both from
      external and internal sources.

        - c. Employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;
        - d. Maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and
        - e. Terminates session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.
    Supplemental Guidance:
      Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or
      an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system
      component and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the
      network access requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication.
      Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in
      MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.

        - b. Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component, or information system service that describes:
          - 1. User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security functions/mechanisms;
          - 2. Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or service in a more secure manner; and
          - 3. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service;
        - c. Documents attempts to obtain information system, system component, or information system service documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and [Assignment:organization-defined actions] in response;  
        - d. Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management strategy; and
        - e. Distributes documentation to [Assignment:organization-defined personnel or roles].
    Supplemental Guidance:
      This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components,
      and information system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability
      to obtain needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support from developers and contractors.
      In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of security controls.
      The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.
      For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control system would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system.
      Documentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes,
      for example, initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.

    Control Name: ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME/ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE
    Description:
      The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service 
      for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal/external role separation.
    Supplemental Guidance:
      Information systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers.
      To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name
      system servers, one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations
      typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility).
      For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e.,
      from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution information requests from clients
      external to organizations (i.e., on external networks including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access
      authoritative DNS servers in particular roles (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists).

  SC-39:
    Control Name: PROCESS ISOLATION
    Description:
      The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each executing process. 
    Supplemental Guidance:
      Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space.
      Each information system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled
      through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains
      for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. This capability is available in most
      commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

    Control Name: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES
    Description:
      The organization: 
        - a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment:organization-defined personnel or roles]:
          - 1. A system and information integrity policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
          - 2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and information integrity policy and associated system and information integrity controls; and
        - b. Reviews and updates the current:
          - 1. System and information integrity policy [Assignment:organization-defined frequency]; and
          - 2. System and information integrity procedures [Assignment:organization-defined frequency].
    Supplemental Guidance:
      This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and
      control enhancements in the SI family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
      policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies
      and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely,
      can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
      security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor
      in establishing policy and procedures.

    Control Name: SECURITY ALERTS, ADVISORIES, AND DIRECTIVES
    Description:
      The organization: 
        - a. Receives information system security alerts, advisories, and directives from [Assignment:organization-defined external organizations] on an ongoing basis;
        - b. Generates internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed necessary;
        - c. Disseminates security alerts, advisories, and directives to:[Selection (one or more):[Assignment:organization-defined personnel or roles]; [Assignment:organization-defined elements within the organization]; [Assignment:organization-defined external organizations]]; and
        - d. Implements security directives in accordance with established time frames, or notifies the issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.
    Supplemental Guidance:
      The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal government.
      Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance to security directives
      is essential due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals,
      other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include, for example, external mission/business
      partners, supply chain partners, external service providers, and other peer/supporting organizations.
